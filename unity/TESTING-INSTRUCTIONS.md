# Testing Instructions

To test the client using Multiplayer Play Mode:

1. Open the Multiplayer Play Mode menu with `Window > Multiplayer > Multiplayer Play Mode`
2. Check boxes in menu to activate extra players.
3. Once extra player windows appear, start Play Mode
4. Choose one player or the editor window to be the server and click the `Server` button in the top left.
5. Click `Client` on each other player.

If you change any code or update any prefab, you must deactivate and reactivate each additional player in the Multiplayer Play Mode menu to get the changes.

## Playing against the backend

The game server gets each player's gear from the backend and reports back when they extract or die, so
run the backend first, from the repo root:

```sh
dotnet run --project backend/Game.Backend
```

- In the editor, the server finds the backend through `UserSettings/RaidZeroDev.json`. It's created on the
  first run with settings for the local backend, and it isn't committed, so each of you can point yours
  elsewhere. Outside the editor, use `--backend-url` and `--server-token`, or the `RAIDZERO_BACKEND_URL` and
  `RAIDZERO_SERVER_TOKEN` environment variables.
- Every client logs in as a new dev player (`dev-12345`) with the starter kit, and they all join the same
  raid. The console shows `[raid] Server ready`, then a `joined raid` line for each player.
- Press F1 in play mode for the debug inventory: your gear, anything you have open, a button that opens
  the nearest crate, and Take and Drop buttons. Crates are objects with a `LootContainer`.
- Pressing Stop ends the raid, so the dev server is free again straight away. Anyone who didn't extract
  loses their gear; it doesn't matter, because each dev player is new each time.
